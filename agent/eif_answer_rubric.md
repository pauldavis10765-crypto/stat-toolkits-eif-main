# EIF answer rubric

This rubric defines the minimum standard for accepting an EIF derivation or implementation answer. It is designed for grading coding-agent outputs on both routine and hard semiparametric problems.

## 1. Pass/fail checklist

An answer should not be accepted as correct unless it satisfies all applicable items.

```text
[ ] The observed-data unit O is stated.
[ ] The target parameter is a population-level functional, not an estimator.
[ ] Scientific targets are separated from observed-data identification formulas.
[ ] Identification assumptions are stated when the target is causal, missing-data, censored, latent, or coarsened.
[ ] The statistical model is stated.
[ ] The answer says whether the EIF is for the nonparametric observed-data model or a restricted semiparametric model.
[ ] The target is checked for pathwise differentiability.
[ ] Nonregular targets are flagged instead of forced into standard EIF form.
[ ] Nuisance functions are defined at the population level.
[ ] Support, positivity, density, and denominator conditions are stated.
[ ] The likelihood is factorized correctly.
[ ] The score is decomposed correctly.
[ ] Each score component has its conditional mean-zero property stated.
[ ] The pathwise derivative is matched to the EIF by inner products with scores.
[ ] The final IF/EIF is centered and mean-zero.
[ ] The answer verifies the pathwise derivative identity, at least symbolically.
[ ] The expression reduces to known special cases.
[ ] If a formula registry entry is used, applicability is checked rather than assumed.
[ ] If the model is restricted, tangent-space projection is done or explicitly deferred.
[ ] Candidate IF, valid IF, and EIF are distinguished when they differ.
[ ] In research mode, unresolved status is given only after visible verification/projection/operator attempts, with an obstruction ledger.
[ ] The estimator uses the correct pseudo-outcome.
[ ] Standard error uses the empirical variance of estimated EIF values.
[ ] Cross-fitting is recommended or used when nuisance functions are flexibly estimated.
[ ] Positivity diagnostics are recommended for inverse-probability weights.
[ ] Remaining warnings and limitations are stated.
```

## 2. Severity levels for mistakes

### Critical errors

These invalidate the answer.

- Deriving an EIF for an estimator rather than the target parameter.
- Failing to identify a causal or missing-data target before deriving.
- Using an ATE EIF for ATT, QTE, policy value, mediation, IV, survival, or transportability without checking the target.
- Giving a standard EIF for a nonregular target without regularization.
- Calling a full nonparametric IF efficient under a restricted model without projection.
- Missing a likelihood component that affects the target.
- Omitting a required denominator such as \(e(X)\), \(1-e(X)\), \(\pi(X)\), \(g(a\mid X)\), \(\beta\), or \(f(q_\tau)\).
- Producing an expression that is not mean-zero.
- In research mode, stopping at a candidate IF or unresolved projection while an obvious score verification, projection equation, or operator step remains unattempted.
- Calling a valid but non-efficient IF an EIF.

### Major errors

These make the answer unreliable.

- Ambiguous observed-data structure.
- Unclear nuisance definitions.
- Positivity assumptions not stated for inverse weights.
- Sign error in a ratio, contrast, or quantile IF.
- Incorrect conditioning set in a nuisance function.
- Treating a learned policy as fixed without sample splitting or assumptions.
- Using in-sample nuisance predictions with flexible learners and no caveat.
- No special-case checks for a complex formula.

### Minor errors

These should be corrected but may not change the core derivation.

- Notational inconsistency after the target is otherwise clear.
- Missing implementation details when the request was derivation-only.
- Lack of numerical validation suggestions for an otherwise correct symbolic derivation.
- Incomplete citation to a known formula when the derivation is correct.

## 3. Required answer types

### 3.1 Regular identified target

The answer should end with:

```text
Conclusion:
The target is identified and pathwise differentiable under the stated model.
The EIF is ...
```

Then provide the estimator and diagnostics if implementation is requested.

### 3.2 Identified but restricted-model target

The answer should distinguish:

```text
Full nonparametric IF:
...

Valid IF but not EIF, if applicable:
...

Restricted-model EIF:
obtained by projecting onto the restricted tangent space ...
```

If the projection is not performed, say so explicitly.

For research-mode answers, explicitly say what was attempted before stopping at an unresolved projection or candidate IF. If the next step is identifiable, such as writing projection equations or checking all score components, the answer is incomplete until that step is attempted.

### 3.3 Unidentified target

The answer should end with:

```text
Conclusion:
The scientific target is not identified from the observed-data law under the stated assumptions.
No observed-data EIF is available until additional identification assumptions are added.
```

### 3.4 Nonregular target

The answer should end with:

```text
Conclusion:
The target is not pathwise differentiable under the stated nonparametric model.
A standard root-n EIF does not exist.
```

Then suggest a regular alternative if possible.

## 4. Component ledger grading

For hard problems, the answer should include a table like:

```text
Likelihood component | Score | Target depends on it? | IF component
```

Grade the derivation by asking:

- Does every likelihood component appear?
- Is each score's conditional mean-zero restriction correct?
- Are components with no direct target dependence justified, not merely ignored?
- Are inverse weights used only when needed to express conditional derivatives in observed-data form?
- Does the sum of components have mean zero?

---

## 5. Formula registry grading

The formula registry is useful, but it is not proof.

Accept registry use only if the answer also states:

```text
Why this registry entry matches:
- same observed data
- same target
- same model
- same identification assumptions
- same nuisance definitions
- same positivity requirements
```

Reject registry use if the answer only relies on superficial similarity.

---

## 6. Implementation grading

For implementation outputs, require:

- pseudo-outcome construction
- \(\hat\psi\) as the sample mean of the pseudo-outcome when applicable
- \(\hat\phi_i=\text{pseudo_outcome}_i-\hat\psi\)
- standard error \(sd(\hat\phi_i)/\sqrt n\)
- confidence interval
- clipping or diagnostics for probabilities, with a warning that clipping is not a substitute for positivity
- cross-fitting for flexible nuisance estimators
- clear handling of unobserved outcomes, censoring, or missing values

---

## 7. Minimum final verification block

Every final EIF answer should include a short verification block:

```text
Checks:
1. Mean zero: ...
2. Pathwise derivative: ...
3. Special case: ...
4. Positivity/regularity: ...
```

If any check is not available, the answer should say why.
